## Predicting Ralph Lauren Stocks

DISCLAIMER: This project is not suitable to be applied into the real world. It is only created for trivial purposes. 

Using an ETS model and a couple of economic factors, I attempted to forecast the stock prices of Ralph Lauren. 

### Economic Factors:
- Imports and Tariffs
- Currency Exchange Rates
- Consumer Confidence Index

The reason behind choosing these factors are inside the notebook, along with how they performed in terms of correlation. It is safe to say there is almost zero correlation with all of these economic factors and the stock trends, which is why predicting stocks has been almost impossible till date.
